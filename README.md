Automation of Machine Learning Training for Classification.
There are 7 Algorithms used which the hyperparameters can be customized. Inside the process there are Optuna for hyperparameter tuning and NiaPy for Feature Selection (Except for KNN, the method used is choosing 10 columns with highest correlation and choose the best features using brute force).

<ol>
  <li>Random Forest</li>
  <li>Decision Tree</li>
  <li>XGBoost</li>
  <li>Logistic Regression</li>
  <li>SVM</li>
  <li>KNN</li>
  <li>Naive Bayes</li>
</ol>

You can choose to use all of them and go to sleep and wake up with bar chart of each model performance (Accuracy)
